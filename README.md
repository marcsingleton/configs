# Configs

This is a collection of configuration files for various programs I use regularly. Many of these programs have extensive options, so I've collected the useful ones I've found over the years in one place. Some files are aggregated from various machines, so not all of them will be necessary on every system. I annotated the motivations and/or effects where I felt more explanation was necessary, and if you're interested in using these files, I encourage you to examine each in detail and pick the options that make sense for your use case. Additionally, some files are named differently from their "active" versions. In most cases, the difference is just a preceding dot, so these templates aren't hidden on a file explorer. In others, the file name gives a hint for the file's typical path or corresponding program. In case of any confusion, consult the program's documentation for where it usually looks for configuration files.
