# dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files for various programs I use regularly. Many have extensive options, so I've collected the useful ones I've found over the years in one place. Some options are aggregated from various machines, so not all of them are necessary on every system. I annotated the motivations and/or effects where I felt more explanation was necessary, and if you're interested in using these files, examine each in detail and pick the options that make sense for your use case.

Many files in this repo are named differently from their "active" versions to keep things organized and visible in a file explorer. In most cases, the difference is just a preceding dot (hence the name of this repo). In others, the file name gives a hint for its typical path or corresponding program. When in doubt, consult the program's documentation for where it usually looks for configuration files.
